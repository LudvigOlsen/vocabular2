Friends to this ground.
A piece of him.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Together with that fair and warlike form...
Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch...
As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armour he had on...
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,...
That can I.
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,...
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,...
Do, if it will not stand.
'Tis here!
And then it started, like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard...
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,...
Hail to your lordship!
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
O, where, my lord?
I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, the King your father.
Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver...
Two nights together had these gentlemen
(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch...
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none. Yet once methought...
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty...
O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Nay, very pale.
Most constantly.
It would have much amaz'd you.
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Not when I saw't.
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
I warr'nt it will.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
I think it lacks of twelve.
Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk....
Is it a custom?
Look, my lord, it comes!
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire...
No, by no means!
Do not, my lord!
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff...
Be rul'd. You shall not go.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Heaven will direct it.
[within] My lord, my lord!
Heaven secure him!
What news, my lord?
Good my lord, tell it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven!
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
There's no offence, my lord.
What is't, my lord? We will.
In faith,
My lord, not I.
Propose the oath, my lord.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
O, my dear lord!
Well, my lord.
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,...
Half a share.
You might have rhym'd.
Very well, my lord.
I did very well note him.
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
What are they that would speak with me?
Let them come in.
[Exit Attendant.]...
Let him bless thee too.
[reads the letter] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have...
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
It might, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Not a jot more, my lord.
Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
What's that, my lord?
E'en so.
E'en so, my lord.
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Good my lord, be quiet.
Remember it, my lord!
That is most certain.
Is't possible?
I beseech you.
Ay, good my lord.
How was this seal'd?
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Why, what a king is this!
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.
Peace! Who comes here?
[aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
[aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
[aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
spent.
[aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
ere you had done.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
Nay, good my lordâ€”
If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
repair hither and say you are not fit.
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane....
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!...
What is it you will see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
Not from his mouth,
Had it th' ability of life to thank you....
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more....
