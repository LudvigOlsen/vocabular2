Do you doubt that?
No more but so?
I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,...
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
In honourable fashion.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
I shall obey, my lord.
O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,...
My lord, I do not know,
But truly I do fear it.
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm,...
No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
I did repel his letters and denied...
Madam, I wish it may.
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to re-deliver....
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd...
My lord?
What means your lordship?
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
I was the more deceived.
At home, my lord.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
O heavenly powers, restore him!
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,...
No, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
I think nothing, my lord.
What is, my lord?
You are merry, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
What means this, my lord?
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,...
'Tis brief, my lord.
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
Still better, and worse.
The King rises.
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
[sings]
How should I your true-love know...
Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
(Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,...
Pray you mark.
(Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-
[Sings]
Larded all with sweet flowers;...
Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at...
Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
it means, say you this:...
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
[Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,...
I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground....
[sings]
They bore him barefac'd on the bier...
You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his...
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays....
[sings]
And will he not come again?...
