Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted...
We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
[Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.]...
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!...
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father;...
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come....
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,...
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
[Exit Polonius.]...
Well, we shall sift him.
[Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.]...
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,...
But how hath she
Receiv'd his love?
As of a man faithful and honourable.
Do you think 'tis this?
Not that I know.
How may we try it further?
We will try it.
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,...
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclin'd....
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,...
[aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!...
Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,...
It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
mine.
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
What do you call the play?
Give me some light! Away!
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;...
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,...
Thanks, dear my lord.
[Exit [Polonius].]...
[rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit.
There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them....
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there....
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch...
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!...
But where is he?
Bring him before us.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
At supper? Where?
Alas, alas!
What dost thou mean by this?
Where is Polonius?
Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
Which we do tender as we dearly grieve...
Ay, Hamlet.
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night....
How do you, pretty lady?
Conceit upon her father.
Pretty Ophelia!
How long hath she been thus?
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
[Exit Horatio.]...
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
[Enter a Messenger.]...
The doors are broke.
What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?...
Dead.
Let him demand his fill.
Who shall stay you?
Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty...
Will you know them then?
Why, now You speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman....
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,...
So you shall;
And where th' offence is let the great axe fall....
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
And You must put me in your heart for friend,...
O, for two special reasons,
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,...
Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull...
From Hamlet? Who brought them?
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us....
'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'...
If it be so, Laertes
(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),...
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
As checking at his voyage, and that he means...
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,...
A very riband in the cap of youth-
Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes...
A Norman.
The very same.
He made confession of you;
And gave you such a masterly report...
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,...
Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time,...
No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,...
Let's further think of this,
Weigh what convenience both of time and means...
Let's follow, Gertrude.
How much I had to do to calm his rage I...
Pluck them asunder.
O, he is mad, Laertes.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
[Exit Horatio.]...
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,...
Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health....
Our son shall win.
Gertrude, do not drink.
[aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
I do not think't.
Part them! They are incens'd.
She sounds to see them bleed.
O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
