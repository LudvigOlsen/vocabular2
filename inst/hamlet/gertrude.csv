Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark....
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
And sure I am two men there are not living...
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit...
Ay, amen!
I doubt it is no other but the main,
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
More matter, with less art.
Came this from Hamlet to her?
it may be, very like.
So he does indeed.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Did he receive you well?
Did you assay him
To any pastime?
I shall obey you;
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish...
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
How fares my lord?
I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Why, how now, Hamlet?
Have you forgot me?
Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
Help, help, ho!
O me, what hast thou done?
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
As kill a king?
What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
Ah me, what act,
That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
O Hamlet, speak no more!
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,...
O, speak to me no more!
These words like daggers enter in mine ears....
No more!
Alas, he's mad!
Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,...
To whom do you speak this?
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
No, nothing but ourselves.
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy...
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
What shall I do?
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe...
Alack,
I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
Bestow this place on us a little while.
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]...
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit...
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore...
I will not speak with her.
What would she have?
Let her come in.
[Exit Gentleman.]...
How now, Ophelia?
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Nay, but Ophelia-
Alas, look here, my lord!
Alack, what noise is this?
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
Calmly, good Laertes.
But not by him!
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream....
Drown'd, drown'd.
Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
[Scatters flowers.]...
Hamlet, Hamlet!
O my son, what theme?
For love of God, forbear him!
This is mere madness;
And thus a while the fit will work on him....
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows....
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me. Drinks.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. [Dies.]
