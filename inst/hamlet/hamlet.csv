[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,...
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!...
I am glad to see you well.
Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?...
I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do my ear that violence...
I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables....
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
He was a man, take him for all in all.
I shall not look upon his like again.
Saw? who?
The King my father?
For God's love let me hear!
But where was this?
Did you not speak to it?
'Tis very strange.
Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
Arm'd, say you?
From top to toe?
Then saw you not his face?
What, look'd he frowningly.
Pale or red?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
I would I had been there.
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
His beard was grizzled- no?
I will watch to-night.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape...
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
[Exeunt [all but Hamlet].]...
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
What hour now?
The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,...
Ay, marry, is't;
But to my mind, though I am native here...
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,...
It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;...
It waves me still.
Go on. I'll follow thee.
Hold off your hands!
My fate cries out
And makes each petty artire in this body...
Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
I will.
Alas, poor ghost!
Speak. I am bound to hear.
What?
O God!
Murther?
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,...
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle?
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!...
So be it!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
No, you will reveal it.
How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
Why, right! You are in the right!
And so, without more circumstance at all,...
I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, faith, heartily.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,...
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Nay, but swear't.
Upon my sword.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage....
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.
Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,...
Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,...
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you;...
Well, God-a-mercy.
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
pick'd out of ten thousand.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
Words, words, words.
Between who?
Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes...
Into my grave?
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my...
These tedious old fools!
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
favours?
In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
strumpet. What news ?
Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,...
Denmark's a prison.
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my...
No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most...
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were...
Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties...
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the...
[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
not off.
I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no...
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and...
How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
city? Are they so follow'd?
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can...
Is't possible?
Do the boys carry it away?
It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give...
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply...
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
know a hawk from a handsaw.
Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling...
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome-
Buzz, buzz!
Then came each actor on his ass-
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Why,
'One fair daughter, and no more,...
Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
Nay, that follows not.
Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'...
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd...
It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to...
'The mobled queen'?
'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you...
God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own...
Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
[Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].]...
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and...
Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[Exit First Player.]...
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]...
To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer...
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
No, not I!
I never gave you aught.
Ha, ha! Are you honest?
Are you fair?
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can...
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you...
Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse...
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape...
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you...
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our...
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with...
O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them...
Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
help to hasten them?
What, ho, Horatio!
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee,...
They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
Get you a place.
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
i' th' university, you say?
What did you enact?
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
the players ready.
No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Do you think I meant country matters?
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
Nothing.
Who, I?
O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died...
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten...
Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
they'll tell all.
Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
As woman's love.
[aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
Queen. The instances that second marriage move...
If she should break it now!
Madam, how like you this play?
O, but she'll keep her word.
No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
world.
'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;...
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
the puppets dallying.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth...
He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.
The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You...
What, frighted with false fire?
Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;...
A whole one I!
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,...
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
pound! Didst perceive?
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
For if the King like not the comedy,...
Sir, a whole history.
Ay, sir, what of him?
With drink, sir?
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps...
I am tame, sir; pronounce.
You are welcome.
Sir, I cannot.
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,...
O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
further trade with us?
And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
Sir, I lack advancement.
Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
musty....
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
I pray you.
I do beseech you.
It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will...
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would...
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Methinks it is like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]...
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,...
[within] Mother, mother, mother!
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
What's the matter now?
No, by the rood, not so!
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,...
Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass...
[draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
Ay, lady, it was my word.
[Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]...
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;...
Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers....
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,...
A murtherer and a villain!
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe...
A king of shreds and patches!-
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,...
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by...
How is it with you, lady?
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,...
Do you see nothing there?
Nor did you nothing hear?
Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!...
Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time...
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half,...
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;...
I must to England; you know that?
There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,...
Safely stow'd.
But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Do not believe it.
That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son...
Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in...
I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
The King is a thing-
Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
At supper.
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your...
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
the guts of a beggar.
In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you...
He will stay till you come.
For England?
Good.
I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.
My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Good sir, whose powers are these?
How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
Who commands them, sir?
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw....
I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]...
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
grave-making?
'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense.
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that...
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that...
Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,...
There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,...
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
What man dost thou dig it for?
What woman then?
Who is to be buried in't?
How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years...
How long is that since?
Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
Why?
How came he mad?
How strangely?
Upon what ground?
How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
Why he more than another?
Whose was it?
Nay, I know not.
This?
Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,
Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He...
Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
And smelt so? Pah!
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it...
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,...
That is Laertes,
A very noble youth. Mark.
What, the fair Ophelia?
[comes forward] What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow...
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;...
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
Could not (with all their quantity of love)...
'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?...
Hear you, sir!
What is the reason that you use me thus?...
So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay...
Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark...
Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
Being thus benetted round with villanies,
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,...
An earnest conjuration from the King,
As England was his faithful tributary,...
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,...
Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
They are not near my conscience; their defeat...
Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;...
It will be short; the interim is mine,
And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'...
I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
waterfly?
[aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be...
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
I beseech you remember.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I
know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of...
The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath?
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Of him, sir.
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
much approve me. Well, sir?
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
What's his weapon?
That's two of his weapons- but well.
What call you the carriages?
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then....
How if I answer no?
Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be...
To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes...
I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided...
In happy time.
She well instructs me.
I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not...
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman.
Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be...
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman....
I embrace it freely,
And will this brother's wager frankly play....
I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,...
No, by this hand.
Very well, my lord.
Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Come on, sir.
One.
Judgment!
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?
Good madam!
I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
Pray you pass with your best violence;...
Nay come! again! The Queen falls.
How does the Queen?
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
Treachery! Seek it out.
The point envenom'd too?
Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the King.
Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?...
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!...
As th'art a man,
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't....
O, I die, Horatio!
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit....
